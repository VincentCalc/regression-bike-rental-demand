# Forecasting Bike Rental Demand

### Background
Bike sharing systems are the new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return has become automatic. Through these systems, the user can easily rent a bike from a particular position and return back to another position.

Apart from interesting real world applications of bike sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
these systems make them attractive for the research. Opposed to other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns bike sharing system into
a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that most of the important
events in the city could be detected via monitoring these data.

### Dependencies
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Dataset
The dataset contains some riders aggregated on an hourly basis (hour.csv or a daily basis (daily.csv). The dataset was obtained from Capital Bikeshare System( http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)

### Notebook 
The Jupyter notebook (regression-bike-rental-demand) is a step by step guide for building a neural network and predicting bike rentals.
